# a very important information
The file "комп_V5.circ" - is the main project file, it contains schemes of a computer (vanila logisim was used).
The files "prototype of 'name'.circ" - are prototypes of schemes, that could be used in the main project. They don't depend on the main project file.

The libraries "file_name.jar" - contains additional blocks for logisim-win-2.7.1.
(ATTENTION! ONLY FOR VANILA LOGISIM! YOU CAN TRY IT FOR LOGISIM EVOLUTION, BUT SIMULATION MAY BE CRASHED/STOPED!)
If you have problems with loading it - open комп_V5.circ with the help of notepad, the text there contains everything you need; or choose the right name from the list below:

IEEE754.jar - com.cheese.IEEE754.IEEE754
Buzzer.jar -immibis.buzzer.Library
cs3410for271.jar - edu.cornell.cs3410.Components
kahgeg.jar - kahdeg.test.library
logisim_xtended - net.net16.jeremiahlowe.logisim.logisim_xtended.Componen
midi.jar - kahdeg.test.library
midikeyboard.jar - com.mcsoftware.logisim.mykeyboardlib.MyKeyboardLib
EvolutionComp.jar - com.mcsoftware.logisim.evolutioncomp.EvolutionComp

Then copy/paste it to the special logisim window, that requires a name of a main class. Later I will add new libraries.
