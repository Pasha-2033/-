# very important information
File "комп_V5.circ" - is  the main project file, it contains scheems of a computer (was used vanila logisim)

Libraries "file_name.jar" - contains additional blocks for logisim-win-2.7.1 (ATTENTION! ONLY FOR VANILA LOGISIM! YOU CAN TRY IT FOR LOGISIM EVOLUTION, BUT SIMILATION MAY BE CRASHED!)
If you have problems with loading it - open комп_V5.circ with notepad, there are all names of main classes or choose right name from the list below:

IEEE754.jar - com.cheese.IEEE754.IEEE754
Buzzer.jar -immibis.buzzer.Library
cs3410for271.jar - edu.cornell.cs3410.Components
kahgeg.jar - kahdeg.test.library
logisim_xtended - net.net16.jeremiahlowe.logisim.logisim_xtended.Componen
midi.jar - kahdeg.test.library
midikeyboard.jar - com.mcsoftware.logisim.mykeyboardlib.MyKeyboardLib
EvolutionComp.jar - com.mcsoftware.logisim.evolutioncomp.EvolutionComp

(copy it and paste it, to the special logisim window, that requires from you a name of a class), later I will write all names of main classes...

Before using these files please watch my videos about them!
